# 3. A paragraph on what PaaS, SaaS and IaaS are and the differences between them.

## 0. Summary:
- SaaS platforms involve software that is available via third-party over the Internet. SaaS offers ready-to-use, out-of-the-box solutions that meet a particular business need (such as a website or email). Most modern SaaS platforms are built on IaaS or PaaS platforms.

- PaaS focuses primarily on hardware and software tools available over the internet. PaaS is most often built on top of an IaaS platform to reduce the need for system administration. It allows you to focus on app development instead of infrastructure management.
  
- IaaS works primarily with cloud-based and pay-as-you-go services such as storage, networking and virtualization. IaaS is there to provide you with maximum flexibility when it comes to hosting custom-built apps, as well as providing a general data center for data storage.


## 1. SaaS: 

- SaaS replaces traditional on-device software. It uses the web to deliver applications that are managed by a third-party vendor and whose interface is accessed on the clients’ side. Most SaaS applications can be run directly from a web browser without any downloads or installations required, although some require plugins.

- **Pros:**
  - Available over the internet.
  - Hosted on a remote server by a third-party provider.
  - Scalable, with different tiers for small, medium, and enterprise-level businesses.
  - Inclusive, offering security, compliance, and maintenance as part of the cost.
- **Cons:**
  - Data Security: With data primarily located in off-premise servers, security could potentially become an issue.
  - Interoperability: Integrations with existing applications and services can be a concern since many SaaS apps are not designed for open integrations. Finding a service with integration capabilities can be difficult, and attempting to create your own can be worse. 
  - Customization: SaaS services typically allow minimal customization for features, capabilities and integrations. This can force companies to invest significant resources into managing or adding customization capabilities. 
  - Lack of control: With a SaaS solution, businesses often have to hand over ultimate control to the third-party service providers — giving them the keys to functionality, performance and even data. You will want to ensure that you trust the provider used or have the ability to review your information remotely.


## 2. PaaS:
-  PaaS is used for applications, and other development, while providing cloud components to software. What developers gain with PaaS is a framework they can build upon to develop or customize applications. PaaS makes the development, testing, and deployment of applications quick, simple, and cost-effective. With this technology, enterprise operations, or a third-party provider, can manage OSes, virtualization, servers, storage, networking, and the PaaS software itself. Developers, however, manage the applications.
- Enterprise PaaS provides line-of-business software developers a self-service portal for managing computing infrastructure from centralized IT operations and the platforms that are installed on top of the hardware. The enterprise PaaS can be delivered through a hybrid model that uses both public IaaS and on-premise infrastructure or as a pure private PaaS that only uses the latter.
- PaaS allows you to create applications using software components that are built into the PaaS (middleware).
- Applications using PaaS inherit cloud characteristic such as scalability, high-availability, multi-tenancy, SaaS enablement, and more.

- **Pros:**
  - Accessible by multiple users.
  - Scalable — you can choose from various tiers of resources to suit the size of your business.
  - Built on virtualization technology.
  - Easy to run without extensive system administration knowledge.
- **Cons:**
  - Integrations: With PaaS, you may encounter challenges when integrating new applications. This is tied into issues related to legacy systems since there are often aspects of these systems that aren’t built for the cloud. 
  - Data security: Using third-party servers for your data could potentially lead to additional security risks. Security options may also be limited since you will have to find a solution that can integrate with the third-party systems.
  - Runtime: PaaS solutions may not be fully optimized for the language and frameworks your business uses and finding a specifically tailored solution may be difficult. 
  - Operational limitations: Customized cloud operations may not be compatible with PaaS solutions, especially those with management automation workflows. This can inhibit your operational capabilities and limit the full scope of your business.  


## 3. IaaS:
- IaaS are self-service models for accessing, monitoring, and managing remote data-center infrastructures, such as compute (virtualized or bare metal), storage, networking, and networking services (e.g. firewalls). It provides cloud-based alternatives to on-premise, physical infrastructure.
- It works primarily with cloud-based and pay-as-you-go services such as storage, networking and virtualization, allowing businesses to purchase resources on-demand instead of the more costly venture of having to buy and manage hardware.

- **Pros:**
  - Highly flexible and highly scalable.
  - Have control over the infrastructure.
  - Accessible by multiple users.
  - Cost-effective.
- **Cons:**
  - Legacy systems: Before a full migration to the cloud is completed, any legacy technology or applications should be reviewed for compatibility. There are many older systems that are not designed for cloud-based services and may need to be upgraded or replaced. 
  - Security: With the move from on-premise to the cloud, there could be new security threats, whether sources from the host or other virtual machines (VMs). It is critical that organizations review and research up-to-date security threats and their remediation strategies. 
  - Internal Training: With a new system comes a lack of familiarity with its intricacies. Businesses should prepare additional training and resources to ensure their users know what they are doing.

### IaaS vs. PaaS

IaaS offers a great deal of control over OSes. It is the foundation of the cloud-computing environment. With PaaS on the other hand, you can build apps without having to host them on-premise, so benefit from more flexibility but get a little less control.

Which service model is best for you, depends on your enterprise’s needs. For example: If you are looking to build a website, an IaaS product like Amazon Webs Services can provide the infrastructure for hosting the site and its applications. However, if you want to add custom features, a PaaS product like Google App Engine does not only host your site but also lets your developers design and deploy custom apps.

### SaaS vs. PaaS

PaaS is used as a way to build new products on top of your already existing network. But SaaS takes this one step further. SaaS products are entirely managed by the vendor and ready to use by your teams.

### IaaS vs. SaaS

With SaaS, you are getting the most service from your third-party provider in terms of software management and maintenance. With IaaS on the other hand, the provider only supplies and maintains core components such as servers or storage.
